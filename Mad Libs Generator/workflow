Day 1: Setting Up the Project

    Choose a Story Template: Find a simple story template or write your own. Start with a short story with 3-4 placeholders for different word types (e.g., adjectives, nouns,

    verbs).
    Plan Word Lists: Decide on 3-4 word types you want to use (e.g., adjectives, nouns, verbs). Create separate lists for each type with 5-10 words each.
    Coding Environment: Set up your Python development environment. Choose a code editor like Visual Studio Code or a platform like Google Colab.

Day 2: User Input and Basic Functionality

    User Prompts: Write code to use the input() function to prompt the user for words based on your chosen categories (e.g., "Enter an adjective").
    Variable Storage: Store the user-provided words in variables for later use (e.g., user_adjective = input()).
    Story Building with Replace: Start with a simple approach. Use a loop to iterate through the story template a few times, replacing each placeholder with a generic word (e.g., replace "ADJECTIVE" with "something"). This helps visualize how the replacement works.

Day 3: Refining the Replacement Logic

    Targeted Replacement: Now, target specific placeholders in the story based on their keyword (e.g., use replace("ADJECTIVE", user_adjective)).
    Iterative Replacement: Complete the loop to replace all placeholders in the story with their corresponding user input variables.

Day 4: Testing and Improvement

    Test with Sample Inputs: Run the code with different user inputs to ensure the replacements happen correctly.
    Error Handling: Consider adding basic error handling (e.g., if the user enters a number instead of a word).
    Clear Output Formatting: Format the final story output for readability (e.g., add newlines after each sentence).

Day 5: Adding Features (Optional)

    More Word Types: If you have time, expand your word lists by adding new categories (e.g., adverbs, verbs in different tenses).
    Random Selection: Instead of user input, explore using random.choice() to pick a random word from each list for a surprising story.
    Multiple Stories: Create a few more story templates with different themes and allow the user to choose which one to play with. (This might require additional coding for user selection).

Day 6 and 7: Polishing and Documentation

    Code Cleanup and Comments: Review your code, add comments to explain each section, and improve readability.
    Test with Various Inputs: Test the program thoroughly with different combinations of user inputs, including edge cases.
    Documentation (Optional): If you want to share your project, write a short README file explaining how to run your program.

Remember:

    Start simple and gradually add complexity.
    Focus on getting the core functionality working first.
    You can always come back and add more features later.
    Don't hesitate to search online resources and tutorials for help with specific coding parts.

By following these steps, you can create a functional and potentially fun Mad Libs Generator within a week!
